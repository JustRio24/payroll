Improve this application with the following fully integrated upgrades. All features must work 100% locally using MySQL, and any database changes must also be applied to database_setup.sql so the local environment can be installed cleanly.

1. Fix and Enhance the Overtime (Lembur) System
A. Fix overtime logic so it works correctly

Correct all overtime calculations so they follow actual rules:

Based on normal working hours

Based on actual clock-in and clock-out times

Based on true overtime duration

Ensure overtime is recorded accurately and appears in:

Attendance recap

Monthly reports

Admin dashboard

Employee dashboard

B. Add configurable overtime settings

In the Settings → Config page, add an option to configure overtime hours/thresholds.

This configuration must control how overtime is calculated (to allow demo/testing).

Store these configs in the database.

C. Add manual bonus input during salary slip generation

When admin generates a payslip for a specific employee:

Add a field for “Manual Bonus”

Bonus must be saved into payroll records

Bonus appears in the final salary slip

2. Make All Dashboard & Application Data Fully Realtime
A. Admin Dashboard – Recent Activity

Fix recent activity so it shows the actual latest activity, based on:

ORDER BY created_at DESC


Must include recent:

Attendance

Clock-in / Clock-out

Overtime

Leave/permission

Employee updates

Any relevant activity

B. Realtime data everywhere

Remove all cached, hardcoded, or stale data.

All data across the entire app must always be loaded fresh from MySQL:

Attendance

Employee data

Overtime

Activity logs

Settings

Pay slips

All updates must immediately reflect on the UI.

3. Fix Late Calculation (Telat)

Correct all late/early calculations:

Use scheduled working hours from Settings Config

Compare clock-in time vs scheduled start time

Calculate actual late duration in minutes using a proper formula

Save late minutes to the database

Display late status consistently in:

Admin dashboard

Attendance recap

Employee history

Remove any incorrect or shifting time calculations.

4. Add the “About Company” Feature

Add a new “About Company” menu on:

Admin dashboard

Employee dashboard

The page must load company profile data from the existing Settings Config:

Company name

Address

Email

Phone

Website

Company description

Company logo

Display the page neatly and responsively.

5. Fix All Timezone & Time Differences (Critical)

Fix the issue shown in the attached screenshots where:

The time stored in database

The time displayed in reports
do not match

Ensure consistent timezone handling across:

MySQL

Backend server

Frontend/browser

All timestamps must be aligned using a single timezone (preferably Asia/Jakarta).

Also fix:

Time formatting

Time parsing

Any JavaScript Date issues

Any backend timezone offsets

SQL timezone mismatches

After fixing, all timestamps MUST appear identical between:

Database records

Reports

Dashboard

Attendance logs

6. Ensure Full Local Functionality + Update Database Setup

After implementing all changes:

Confirm the app works 100% on a clean local environment with MySQL

Update database_setup.sql with:

Any new columns

Modified columns

New tables

Index changes

Default values

A fresh install using this SQL file must run without errors.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

After completing all changes, provide a detailed summary including:

List of all modified files

All database schema changes + updated database_setup.sql

Explanation of fixes to:

Overtime logic

Overtime settings

Manual bonus addition

Realtime data improvements

Recent activity correction

Late calculation fix

Explanation of timezone synchronization

How to run the app locally without time inconsistencies

Everything must be tested and confirmed working.
